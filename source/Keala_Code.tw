:: Bathroom

You've entered the Bathroom.
You shouldn't have been able to make it this far. I mean, honestly, look at you. 
You wouldn't have been able to make it this far without me. And how do you repay me?
By ignoring me! You know that without me, you're nothing, right?

[[Ignore-> Mock]]
[[Shut Up!-> Rage]]

:: Mock
I'm right aren't I? You know I always am. 
[[Ignore-> Focus]]
[[Cry Break-> Cry]]

:: Rage
No, you shut up! You know as well as I do that your worthless and can't do 
anything for yourself without me!

:: Focus

One step at a time.
[[Look around-> First Glance]]

:: Cry
Sometimes, in the heat of things, it's okay to let yourself cry. Just remember to not 
stay there for too long. 
[[Deep Breath-> Focus]]

:: First Glance
Hey, what the hell do you think you're doing, snooping around? It's rude to go 
searching through things that aren't yours. Oh wait, I'm all you have, isn't that right?
